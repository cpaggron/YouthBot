# Youth Bot

*Anyone can use part of the code if they understand. Do **NOT** copy the whole code. (I made sure to include a lot of comments so you can follow it)*

The JSON files are not up to date (because it's constantly changing). The version I have here is the basic format. It's just there to let you know it's in my files.

`main.py` is the file I run while `directory.py` is a module made to add a user to a dictionary. 

Bot written with Python. (Discord.py)
